## Week 1 Project: Cat Facts

### Project Overview

"Cat Facts" involves creating an application that fetches cat facts from an API, stores them in an SQLite database, and displays the information from the database. This project helps in gaining experience with API usage, data storage, and simple data visualization.

### Features

- **Database Creation:** Creates an SQLite database and a table to store the fetched data.
- **Data Storage:** Saves the cat facts retrieved from the API into the database.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays the cat facts stored in the database.
